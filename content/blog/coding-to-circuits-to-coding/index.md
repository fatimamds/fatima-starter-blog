description: How I changed my stream from coding to electronics and started coding again.
---

I started coding **C++** in high school, at about 15 years of age, and absolutely fell in love with
 it. I enjoyed coding and ended up graduating high school with highest grades in the school. Little
 did I know then that my tech journey would be a roller coaster.

### Why I chose Electronics?

After I graduated high school I faced a huge confusion while deciding my career path. I definitely 
wanted to delve into coding further, but a part of me insisted to take up a hardware oriented 
major, for the fascination of understanding the hardware which we use to code, more better. 
Fortuitously, the latter won. I ended up taking B.E. in _Electronics &amp; Communication 
Engineering_.

There have been times I felt truly interested in parts of understanding the hardware that goes 
behind making these high-tech devices. But there have also been times where I rued my decision. I 
spent four years going from analog &amp; digital circuits to analog &amp; digital signal 
processing, from flip-flops, registers &amp; counters to antenna systems &amp; VLSI. And I could 
have said that I am not very proud of my decision of pursuing a stream that does not involve a lot 
of coding, but now that I look back, I actually am. It did get me off the track of what my heart 
pursued, for a time being, but it gave me a huge insight of the inner workings of hardware. This 
allows me to really appreciate all the coding I do now.

By the time I completed my degree, I stopped fancying pursuing coding as my career. I was an 
electronic engineer now after all. I decided to settle down with a job in a core company - only 
until I realized how hard the competition was. And guess what? I didn&#39;t find the passion within
 me to work hard to secure a job in one of these companies. My mind refused to put in work for 
something it found boring. And I knew then, that my final destination was coding, back again.

### Back to Square One

Now that I knew that I really have to invest into my true passions, I needed a place to start. And
 like every astray engineer who finds a new light, my first stop was online training. I took up 
Java and Web Development courses, in hopes of catching up with the fellow coders. These courses did
 help me understand coding, but nonetheless, I couldn&#39;t find that confidence in building things
 on my own.

I knew I needed a push. I then made a daunting decision of pursuing masters in the IT, alongside 
other coders, despite of coming from an electronics background. So I took up M.Tech. in _Computer 
Networks &amp; Information Security_. It did help me get into the coding mindset back again. I once
 again started enjoying the coding and debugging process, like I used to during my high-school. I 
quickly became the most sought-after in my class for troubleshooting programming errors. I was 
enjoying the perks of coding again, but somewhere I still found it intimidating to build things 
from scratch. Eventually, I messed my college mini project due to the under-confidence I had in 
myself.

Fast forward to the pandemic we&#39;re in. This pandemic has been a blessing as well as a curse in 
my life. A blessing because it made me realize that confidence doesn&#39;t gets built simply. 
Confidence builds when we step out of our comfort zones to take a step forward and be really 
proactive, and take full responsibility of our own development. I started learning full-stack **Web
 Development** again, but this time with all my heart and mind to it, while taking baby steps 
toward building new things. I brushed up with the **Machine Learning** skills I learnt during a 
workshop in my college, and built on top of it. I am still learning, but the difference now is that
 I am applying it too, which makes a whole world of difference in my confidence.
